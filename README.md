# Well-Grounded Rubyist 2nd-Edition By David Black

This repo represents a starting point for my learning of the Ruby programming language.
Initially I found no need to make as many comments and small coding scripts on what was covered in the earlier chapters, however as the book continued I foung myself adding more and more content into each little script.

My hope is as I continue my learning that I am able to add additional material I come across outside the scope of the book and make this my own personal library of interesting techniques and methods that I can comment on and use whilst programming with Ruby.

If anyone other than myself comes across this and shows an interest (I doubt I'm that interesting to be honest haha) then feel free to expand on this and submit any commits with what you feel might be beneficial additional information. The idea is for this to be a short hand of the book and more, so as to refresh those little bits forgetten by anyone who might have not used some of the material for a while or if they've rusty on how to implement any specific methods.

I might add I came across an intereting pdf on using Git that also resides in this repo as additional learning material to those who might want to know so further information on Git too. It's about 7MB so takes a little while to clone this repo. Be patient as it's a good read if you are interested.

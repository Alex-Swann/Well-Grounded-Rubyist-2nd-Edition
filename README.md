# Well-Grounded Rubyist 2nd-Edition By David Black

This repo represents a starting point for my learning of the Ruby programming language.
Initially I found no need to make as many comments and small coding scripts on what was covered in the chapters, however as the book continued I foung myself adding more and more content into each little script.

My hope is as I continue my learning that I am able to add additional material I come across outside the scope of the book as my own personal library of interesting techniques and methods that I can comment on. 

If anyone other than myself comes across this and shows an interest (I doubt I'm that interesting to be honest haha) then feel free to expand on this and submit on commits to this. The idea is for this to be a short hand of the book and more, so as to refresh those little bits forgetten by anyone who might have not used some of the material for a while or if they've forgetten how to implement a specific method.
